# NDMath

Originally, this was going to have math for perfect 4D -> 3D slicing of tetrahedra -> triangles.<br>
However, I have finally concluded my back and forth about whether or not tetrahedra slicing should be done on the CPU vs GPU, and the latter has won.
That doesn't make this repository moot though, as I've wanted to do truly ND math, not just 4D -> 3D slicing, and this was already setup for that.
